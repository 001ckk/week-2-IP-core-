**Data Analytic's Question**

Predicting which individuals are most likely to have bank accounts.

1. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
2. Performing the Linear Discriminant Analysis.

Financial inclusion remains one of the major hinderances to economic and human development in Africa.
Very few adults have access to or use a commercial bank account.
Access to a bank account is considered an indicator to financial inclusion. Despite the penetration of mobile money in African countries, banks still play a vital role in facilitating access to financial services.
