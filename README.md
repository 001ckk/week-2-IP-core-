**Data Analytic's Question**

Predicting which individuals are most likely to have bank accounts.


**Metrics for success.**

1. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
2. Performing the Linear Discriminant Analysis.
3. Challenge the solution and providing insights on improvement of the analysis.

**Context**

Financial inclusion remains one of the major hinderances to economic and human development in Africa.
Very few adults have access to or use a commercial bank account.
Access to a bank account is considered an indicator to financial inclusion. Despite the penetration of mobile money in African countries, banks still play a vital role in facilitating access to financial services.

Our aim is to target find out which persons are most likely to have or use a bank account and thus assist provide insight on and how to improve this financial inclusion.
